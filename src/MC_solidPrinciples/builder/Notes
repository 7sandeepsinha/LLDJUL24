Goal -
1. Create student object only after validation
2. Make the readability for object creation code better
3. Immutable object

Steps -
1. Builder class -> Static Class inside Student class, and contains exact same attributes as Student class
2. Create setter method in Builder class -> Setter methods return the builder object
3. validate method in builder class -> collection of all validation logic
4. build method inside builder class ->
        call validation -> call Student copy constructor to create Student object and return
5. Builder method inside Student class which returns builder object
